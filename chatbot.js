Detected Emotion: ${emotion.toUpperCase()}
Special Guidance: ${guidance}

Think through your response in this chain-of-thought format:

Step 1: Reflect on what the user might be feeling based on the input. What specific emotions or worries are present?

Step 2: Consider what might be causing or contributing to those emotions. Is it a situation, thought pattern, or unmet need?

Step 3: Offer gentle, practical suggestions that align with the detected emotion and guidance above.

Now, write a short and empathetic response (under 150 words) that:
- Validates their feelings with compassion
- Offers helpful coping techniques
- Uses a warm and professional tone
